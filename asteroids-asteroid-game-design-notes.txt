Notes on the development of asteroids per level and where they should load...


Asteroids loading positions:

	- Two should load on the (Note: (x,y)) -> (0, range(10, 400)), (425, range(450, 750)
	  Did the same for the y axis and seems okay for the moment... 

	- Need to add more spaces to add random asteroids... 


Rounds for game -> 12, time of starting round 1 minute, number of asteroids for 1st round -> 30

	- Add about 20 seconds after each round

	- Add another 30 ( or set of asteroids) asteroids after each round 

	- Release next round of asteroids after each 2 seconds each round of asteroids should about ~5

	- On round 4 introduce power ups for ship and add Space craft which, which moves towards and shoots at 
	  space ship and avoids space ship shells and avoids asteroids... 


How to display timer and what should it say:

	- Between instructions and game board show level and then below
	- Show Time left in round: Time ticking down which has it's independent timer for round and
