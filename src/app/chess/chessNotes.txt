What's the key to discipering when a piece can move or attack...? 

Is there really a difference? 

The piece can move in it's own pattern as long as it:

Urgent to do tasks:

- Add primitive movement logic to the game such as
  so basically we click and focus a square then when another sqaure 
  is clicked we need to basically move focused sqaure to new sqaure where
  the square is "canMoveToOrAttack" is true. 
  

- It's not creating check, create a check, and check-mate method.

- Is the piece respecting it's rules of the game such as: 
        - Bishop can't jump or move over it's own pieces
        - If it does move and takes a piece then it can only take that piece and be placed there 


Use this above test case above. 



How to approach this issue of moving pieces?
