  DONE | ->  - Maybe need to move eventlistener from jquery
                   to just an Angular event Listener(click) so that

    - When one bottom card is selected, and you select top card of other stack, it does not select entire row...
      I must check if next selected has children

    - When group of cards is selected and you click top pile, error is thrown


    - Need add function just for top row, on wether a card can be added or not
      I think I have some of the logic confused on this... 

      I think for these reasons I need to leave some comments about if the logic is for the
      top row or for bottom row ect... More bugs will arise until I sort out this logic 
      to make this code bug free finally!


      I know what changes need to take place but for the momment I'm going to
      leave where I am on this project and just move onto the next item to 
      work on...
